<h1>IoT Based Home Automation Systems</h1>

This is a basic front-end mini project for an IoT-based Home Automation System. It is built using HTML and CSS and includes simple web pages to control home devices like lights, fans, and more. The project is focused on design only, without any backend or real IoT connections.
